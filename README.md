The idea behind the [Seam Carving algorithm](https://perso.crans.org/frenoy/matlab2012/seamcarving.pdf) is to find the seam (continuous sequence of the pixels) with the lowest contribution to the image content and then remove it. This process repeats over and over again until we get the required image width or height. In the example below you may see that the hot air balloon pixels contributes more to the content of the image than the sky pixels. Thus, the sky pixels are being removed first.

The importance of each pixel (its so-called energy) is being calculated based on its color (`R`, `G`, `B`) difference between two neighbor pixels. More detailed explanation with examples you may find in my [Content-aware image resizing in JavaScript](https://trekhleb.dev/blog/2021/content-aware-image-resizing-in-javascript/) blog post. Now, if we would set the pixel energy to some really low levels artificially (i.e. by drawing a mask on top of them), the Seam Carving algorithm would perform an _object removal_ for us.

## Features

- [x] Downscaling of the images without distorting their content-intensive parts
- [x] Objects removal during resizing

## Plans

- [ ] Image upscaling
- [ ] Upscale the image to its original size after objects removal  
- [ ] Real-time resizing
